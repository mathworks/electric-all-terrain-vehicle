# Electric Vehicle Powered by Brushless Direct Current (BLDC) Motor

About the submission:
This submission contains a set of models to show the implementation of electric all-terrain vehicles powered by BLDC motor. 
The model is built for the student teams participating in the electric BAJA competition where the vehicle is driven by a BLDC motor. 
The teams can use this example as a reference to build their own vehicle models by changing the parameters and subsystems. 



## Models

### eATV (R2022b)
The model implements a closed-loop electric all-terrain vehicle using a Motor & Drive block. Irrespective of the type of motor, the model can be used for powertrain simulations. The model was built in R2022b version.

### openLoopElectricAtv
This model implements an open-loop electric all-terrain vehicle powered by a BLDC motor with a low fidelity longitudinal vehicle dynamics.  
The model is used for performing open-loop testing and for optimizing vehicle parameters.
